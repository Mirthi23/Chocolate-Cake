COCOA POWDER:
I use a combination of 1/2 cup Dutch processed and 1/4 cup regular unsweetened cocoa powder for a richer cake.
COFFEE:
For a richer chocolate flavour, DISSOLVE 2 teaspoons instant coffee or espresso in the boiling water before adding into the batter. You can't taste the coffee!
SUGAR:
White granulated sugar is used here. You can also use superfine or caster sugar.
SPRINGFORM PAN (PLEASE NOTE)
Springform pans are NOT 100% leakproof. Very thin cake batters such as this one will leak through the base. To combat this issue, line the base with parchment paper coming up where the sides meets the base to create a 'cover'. Place a baking sheet on the shelf below the cake pan (or the bottom of the oven) to catch any stray drips (don't put cake pans directly on the pan).
